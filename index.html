    <blockquote id="text">"Some time ago, probably three years or so, the novelist Robin Sloan sent out a short post about arresting phrases or quotations, which he referred to as amulets...Such phrases or fragments, Sloan suggested, were charged with a certain power. Like an amulet worn around the neck, these words might somehow shield or guide or console or sustain the one who held them close to mind and heart. They form our thinking, our feeling, and our imagination in such a way that they transform how we see the world around us and how we conceive of the range of actions available to us." </blockquote>
